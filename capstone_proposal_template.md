## Proposal
_(approx. 2-3 pages)_

### Problem Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

People classify movies in genres. For marketing purposes graphical artists design movie posters that should instantly transport the information about the genres to the viewer.
This can happen by a magnitude of different cues, e.g we associate cute pets with movies targeted at children, serious facial expressions with thrillers or dramas or 
some actors with a specific genre, e.g. Jack Black with comedy. Humans have generally no problem to catch up this cues and to deduct the movie genre from a short glimpse on the poster. 
First I would like to know if a deep neuron net (DNN) trained by transfer learning is able to catch at least some to this cues and provide results at least better than a naive classifier.
If the first is successfull, I would like to combine the first classifier with one or more other classifiers, e.g. based on the cast, movie tags, or other metadata and see if I can create 
a classifier that is better than the one based on movie posters only.

### Datasets and Inputs
_(approx. 2-3 paragraphs)_


TODO links einf√ºgen
The Project MovieLens is a non commercial, personalised movie recommendation system and relies on the users to provide informations 
about the movie on the one hand and also gathers information from famous movie databases such as imdb or tmdb.

MovieLens provides a dataset of movies with addidional datasets and links to the respective entries in imdb and tmdb.

It is possible to retrieve the posters and other metadata about the movies through the tmdb API. Tmdb allows the usage of its resources (TODO check on that and give a link.)

### Solution Statement
_(approx. 1 paragraph)_

In this section, clearly describe a solution to the problem. The solution should be applicable to the project domain and appropriate for the dataset(s) or input(s) given. Additionally, describe the solution thoroughly such that it is clear that the solution is quantifiable (the solution can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms) , measurable (the solution can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the solution can be reproduced and occurs more than once).

### Benchmark Model
_(approximately 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, provide the details for a benchmark model or result that relates to the domain, problem statement, and intended solution. Ideally, the benchmark model or result contextualizes existing methods or known information in the domain and problem given, which could then be objectively compared to the solution. Describe how the benchmark model or result is measurable (can be measured by some metric and clearly observed) with thorough detail.

### Evaluation Metrics
_(approx. 1-2 paragraphs)_

In this section, propose at least one evaluation metric that can be used to quantify the performance of both the benchmark model and the solution model. The evaluation metric(s) you propose should be appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution. Describe how the evaluation metric(s) are derived and provide an example of their mathematical representations (if applicable). Complex evaluation metrics should be clearly defined and quantifiable (can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms).

### Project Design
_(approx. 1 page)_

In this final section, summarize a theoretical workflow for approaching a solution given the problem. Provide thorough discussion for what strategies you may consider employing, what analysis of the data might be required before being used, or which algorithms will be considered for your implementation. The workflow and discussion that you provide should align with the qualities of the previous sections. Additionally, you are encouraged to include small visualizations, pseudocode, or diagrams to aid in describing the project design, but it is not required. The discussion should clearly outline your intended workflow of the capstone project.

**Before submitting your proposal, ask yourself. . .**

- Does the proposal you have written follow a well-organized structure similar to that of the project template?
- Is each section (particularly **Solution Statement** and **Project Design**) written in a clear, concise and specific fashion? Are there any ambiguous terms or phrases that need clarification?
- Would the intended audience of your project be able to understand your proposal?
- Have you properly proofread your proposal to assure there are minimal grammatical and spelling mistakes?
- Are all the resources used for this project correctly cited and referenced?
